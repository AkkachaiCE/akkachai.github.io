                I works as a teacher assistant and research assistant for a years while I am tring to apply for the job.
                But that time it realy hard to get the job because of the COVID-19, many company start to let the employee working from home and did not get the new employee.
            </p>

            <p class="detail1">
                At that time as a teacher, I go to class room and siting in the back waiting for someone ask the question.
                Sometime my professor let me teach his teacher alone but it is not a hard topic just how to use some software.
            </p>

            <p class="detail1">
                As a research assistant, I do the research about the earthquark that related to the civil engineering such as how can we estimate the damage of building when the earthquake occurred.
                and that time is the first time that I know about the Artificial Intelligence (AI). After that I wish, someday I will work with this AI
            </p>
            </div>

            <h1 class="header2">Now</h1>
            <div class="bgtext">
            <p class="detail1">
                After the COVID-19 situation is getting better, some company got me to work as a technical support. In my job,
                It feels like I am specialist that know every thing about that software but actually I am not.
                But this job make me to find the new knowledge every day for waiting someone to ask the question that they are stucking with.
            </p>
            <p class="detail1">
                About the software that I mentioned earlier which can make the 3D reality modeling from a bunch of picture,
                I have a new challenge that what can we so about this 3D model.
                And I saw that it would be great If I can create some website that can share the 3d model to someone to see it without install the software.
                That is why I enroll to this course for learning some computer programing.
